//CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION
/* 
    Constructor function: is a special type fo function that is used to create and initialize objects.
    Typically used in conjunction with 'new' keyword to create new instance of an object on a template
    or blueprint.

    instance of an object is a unique occurence of an object that is create from a constructor function
        - when is 'new' keyword used?
            = it creates a 'new object' and initializes it with the properties and methods defined in the
                constructor.

                = 'new object' is called "Instance of an object"
        
    create reusable function to create several objects with similar data structures or keys
    
    useful for creating multiple instances

    'this' is a keyword used in a constructor function that will aloow us to assign a new object's properties
        and associating with the values received from a constructor function's parameter.
        
    constructors are like blueprints or template to create our object

    To invokeor call the function, we have to access the property which contains our functions
